            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O that I might not miſcarry in my wiſh for you, namely, that it may prove eventually, a Word whereby you may be ſaved. The Word <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> is hard, you would not have that to be your lot. But pray permit me to tell you, (plainly and publickly without Liſping and Whiſpering) that ſaved you cannot be, and damned you muſt be, except by a true and timous Repentance you flee your Luſts; the infallible truth of which is originated in and built upon his Word, who is Truth it ſelf, and cannot lye, as you may ſee in the 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap.</hi> 13.

            </p>
            <p>O Young People, would you with due care apply theſe, things to your own Souls, it were enough to rent the very Caul of a ſecure Heart. I know ſuch is the Depravation of our. Natures, that if there were, any poſſibility of eſcaping Hell and Damnation, without flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Luſts; we ſhould never voluntarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:39105:4"/>
to this Godly Counſel given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to young <hi>Timothy.</hi> I have read of a Book that the Pope hath called <hi>Taxa Camerae Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicae,</hi> wherein men may know the Rate of any Sin, upon what terms men may keep a Whore, be Drunk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to that it is a bundle of Lyes. But the Inſpired Scriptures may be truly call'd a Rate Book, where any of you may know what a beloved Luſt will coſt without Repeneance <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Wrath of God in Hell: and ſo everlaſtingly true is this, that I beg you to deſpair of ever finding the leaſt Jota of God's Word to fail, or fall to the Ground unaccompliſhed.</p>
            <p>I know you will be tempted to do as other Young People commonly do, namely, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get theſe things, and by the ſloth and averſion of a wretched Heart in conjunction with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's temptations, to be carried away to other trivial matters; wherefore let me intreat you, as ever you would avoid the Curſe of <hi>Reuben [Unſtable as Waters]</hi> to ballaſt your Hearts, by laying in ſtrong and powerful Convictions of the intollerable Evil of Sin, the indiſpenſible neceſſity of Chriſt, and holineſs, the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable worth, and the preciouſneſs of your Souls, and Time, and the unavoidable approach of Death, and Judgment. Look ye, you Young Folks, the Breaſts of whoſe Virginity hath not yet been preſs'd, you are young, and want that, Experience that elder <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have;

and therefore the greater allowance muſt be made; you muſt allow your Souls more time to digeſt the great myſteries of Religion by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Prayer: And you are more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to ſenſual Pleaſures and Sports, and to forget God and your Souls, Death and Judgment. And therefore you muſt ſo much the more chaſtiſe the pregnancy of that Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Folly that is bound up in your Natures by a ſeverer vigilance and abſtinence. When I was young, it pleaſed God of his infinite Mercy, to priviledge me above thouſands with a Religious Education, and by his reſtraining Grace to preſerve me from open Prophaneneſs (bleſſed be his holy Name) But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this (to my own juſt ſhame I mention it) in thoſe early and wanton days of my Youth I was miſerably vain, fooliſh, and diſobedient, ſerving divers Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts and Pleaſures: The bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remembrance whereof hath (for more than 20 Years paſt) coſt me Sighs and Groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable: Oh<hi>!</hi> the time's not to be numbred that I have wiſhed I had been ſick in Bed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſinning againſt ſo good a God; the <hi>Remote parts of the World</hi> that I have been in, the Roads I have journeyed in, the Fields I have watched in, the Nights I have watched on, the Houſes I have lived in, and the Beds I have lain on, can witneſs to my Tears and Sorrows while I have recogniz'd my Vanities and Folly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39105:6"/>
And now foraſmuch as it is utterly impoſſible for me to recall and recover thoſe paſt and miſpent days of my Youth. I would on the bended Knee of Importunity, for my own ſake, as well as your's, beſeech this one thing of you, (as I have of God for you) <hi>(viz.)</hi> to take Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to be effectually perſwaded (by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lord which I have felt) to <hi>Flee that Youthful Luſt,</hi> and with that Godly young man <hi>Moſes,</hi> rather chooſe any Affliction than adventure to ſin; it's a known Sentence <hi>felix quem faciunt,</hi> &amp;c. It's not unknown to many of you, how unwilling I have been drawn to expoſe theſe my homely thoughts to publick view. But an extream thirſt after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Converſion, and Eternal Salvation of your Souls, hath overſwayed me herein: I know God's Bleſſing upon it can make it effectual to reach this end, which is all I aim at, or am am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of; and if it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God to make me a poor weak Inſtrument ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful herein, I ſhall go to my <hi>Grave with joy,</hi> and eſteem it ſo great a Recompence, as if I were young again, or had remembred my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the days of my Youth.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of my own Infirmities, but I write not to you Fathers and <hi>Mnaſons,</hi> old Diſciples; but to Children and Youth, who need not ſtrong Meat, but Milk. If any other ſhould ſo far humble themſelves, as to caſt an Eye upon ſo mean a Diſcourſe, with whom its
<pb facs="tcp:39105:7"/>
buſineſs is not, I would deſire this of them, that inſtead of loading this poor thing and its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with harſh and haſty Cenſures, they would lend it and him their help in their hearty Prayer to God for a Bleſſing upon the one, and an increaſe of Gifts and Grace in the other. I eſteem my ſelf oblig'd to acqudint you, that two of theſe Sermons were Preached above a Year ago, and thoſe Young Men that were not my Auditors then, may be apt to think that I have made great alterations in the tranſcribing of them, for as much as here they will meet with a great deal more than what they heard in a ſingle Sermon about ſix Weeks ago, wherein through the ſtreights of time I could do no more than juſt name many particulars, which formerly I was large upon.</p>
            <p>I ſhall detain you no longer, only add this hearty deſire for you, That while many of your Age are haſtening the Wrath of God upon this poor Nation by their <hi>Atheiſm</hi> &amp; <hi>Immoralities</hi> that you may be frequenting your Cloſets, and on your Knees mourning for your own and the Nations Sins, e're the Lord come upon us with his fierce Anger, and there be no remedy, which is the hearty deſire of him, who is a willing, though weak and unworthy Servant of Chriſt,</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN this Chapter <hi>Paul</hi> proceeds to direct <hi>Tim.</hi> in the right management of his great Work, whereunto he was called; in order to which he inſtructs him, whence he ſhould derive ſtrength for it, <hi>v.</hi> 1. then he exhorts him to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate thoſe truths to others which he had heard, and received from him, <hi>v.</hi> 2. then he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth him to endure hardneſs in his Work, from a two fold Metaphor, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a Souldier, and an Husbandman, who firſt ſtrive and labour, and afterwards receive the reward, and reap the fruit of their pains; from <hi>ver.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> to the <hi>8th.</hi> There he minds him of the Example of Chriſt, who firſt ſuffered, and died and afterwards was raiſed to life again, and thence inferreth that all the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39105:8"/>
faithful who ſuffer with him, ſhall alſo live and reign with him for ever. From <hi>v.</hi> 8. to the <hi>14th.</hi> and then he gives other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, how he ſhould behave himſelf as a workman, that need not be aſhamed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him from all vain and prophane Bablings, and Errors, that began to infeſt the Church of God; adding an argument that if a man purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a Veſſel of Honour, prepared for his Maſters work, from 14. to the <hi>24th.</hi> and ſo he cometh to the words in my Text, <hi>Flee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo youthful Luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which admonition to <hi>Tim.</hi> one would have thought might have been omitted, and that upon a two fold account, <hi>Tim.</hi> had an infirm, weak Body, and ſuch ſickly people uſually incline more to minde a Winding-ſheet than wanton Luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tim.</hi> was a holy young Man, very temperate, for the moſt part drinking only Water; and ſuch cold Liquor was more likely to quench, than inflame the heat of Luſts: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Tim.</hi> was a young Man, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw need to give him this admonition. Well then may you young people need it: Beſure it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for your admonition in theſe laſt and leude days, on whom the end of the World are come<hi>:</hi> Wherefore attend thereunto as for your lives. <hi>Flee youthful luſts.</hi> In which words there is no need of any Logical divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to detain you from this following The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39105:8"/>
propoſition, which (without the leaſt violence done to the Text) naturally floweth from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is a duty of ſpecial concernment, to young people, to flee youthful luſts.</hi> In the proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the reſolution of theſe following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is the import of the word Flee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>What are thoſe Youthful Luſts that you are ſo concerned to flee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Why it as a duty of ſuch ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for Youth to flee thoſe luſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 4. <hi>How young people may beſt Practice this their eſpecial duty to flee youthful luſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is the import of this word Flee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now to Flee imports the ſwifteſt motion, as to run is more than to go, ſo to flee is more then to run; Wings are nimbler than Legs. You know in all motion, there is <hi>terminus a quo, &amp; terminus ad quem,</hi> the terms from which, and the terms to which So it is here flee from ſin to God. Flee <hi>i. e.</hi> to the fartheſt diſtance from ſin, and to the neareſt cloſure and union to God, 11. <hi>Job</hi> 14 <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand put it far away,</hi> How far? ſo far as God puts it away when he pardons ſin, even as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, 103. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12 So ſhould you do in your Repentance for ſin.</p>

               <hi>Sol.</hi> Altho there cannot be in this life a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom from, nor deſtruction of ſins, Being an exiſtence, (this being only the priveledge of the glorified Souls above) yet there may and muſt be a ſubverſion of its Power and Dominion, both in Heart and Life; ſo that the meaning is <hi>flee from thy youthful luſts to the utmoſt diſtance, even as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt,</hi> in reſpect of thy love, and affection to, and practice of theſe luſts: Tho ſin is and will remain in thee, yet maintain a continual alienation in thy heart and endeavours in thy life againſt it, in a diligent uſe of all thoſe ſanctified means, and ſpiritual remedies which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the abandoning thy youthful luſts. Such as theſe following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Vehement deſires and longings of ſoul after the mortification of them in their habits as well as external acts. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Deep humblings of ſoul, and loathings of ſelf, for former yieldings to thy Luſts, 73. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. <hi>So fooliſh and ignorant was I even as a Beaſt before thee.</hi> 31. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18 <hi>I have</hi>

               <hi>ſurely heard Ephraim bemoning himſelf thus, I was as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke. Surely after I was inſtructed, I ſmete upon my thigh, I repented; I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Earneſt cries to Heaven for Preventing, pardoning, and purging Grace, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous ſins; let them not have dominion ever me.</hi> 51.

            <p n="7">7.

I ſhall only allude to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flee youthful luſts,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> fled out of <hi>Sodom.</hi> 19.

And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Reſolution of the firſt Queſtion, what the import of the word Flee is?</p>
            <p>Q. 2. What are thoſe youthful luſts, that you are ſo concerned to Flee?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>In the Diviſion of our lives, there are peculiar, and predominant luſts, incident to each diviſion: Now in the general, Youth is obnoxious to moſt ſins, yet ſome more than others. Youth hath its proper ſins, that hange about, that haunt, and dog that ſeaſon of life; ſome whereof reſpect the temper of their minds, and others the frame of their lives, which I ſhall give you in theſe following Heads.</hi>

            <p>1. <hi>Aireneſs of Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. It is obſervable what name the <hi>Hebrews</hi> give a young Man, <hi>(viz.) Nagnar,</hi> which cometh from a root, that ſignifieth to be toſſed to and fro: Thereby ſetting forth the Levity, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a young Man's mind. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us in the 10. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. that Childhood and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39105:11"/>
Youth are Vanity, light Spirited and Frothy. O how rare a ſight is it to ſee young people ſerious and ſtaid in their minds. Ballaſted, and Ballanced in the matters of Religion. Moſt are as the Apoſtle ſaith of them, toſſed eaſily to and fro with every Wind<hi>:</hi> tho they are born with ſinful corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and are every moment liable to Death and Damnation, while they continue in a natural condition<hi>:</hi> yet they are like the wild Aſs in the Wilderneſs, that ſnuffeth up the Wind at her pleaſure, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks<hi>:</hi> 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. They are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vain in their imagination, their minds are like that of the Poets, full of vain fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and fictions<hi>:</hi> the Eye of their minds like that of their Body, looks all outward, as if they had no Soul to mind. Hence it is that ſo many thouſands of Prayers, Tears, and Inſtructions of faithful Miniſters and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are defeated, and rendred unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, through the Inſtability and Vanity of young peoples ſpirits.</p>
            <p>B. <hi>Boiſtrous, and Bold, adventuring upon ſinful, and pernicious Courſes;</hi> of a <hi>Jehu</hi> like temper, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 10. Furious, and Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate<hi>:</hi> This is that young people are prone to, in the heat of their Youth, to be venturous, as the Horſe that ruſheth into the Battle. Now if you would ſee how the Horſe ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Battle, compare with that 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. the 39. <hi>Job.</hi> 19. and there you have it Now
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39105:12"/>
moſt elegantly, and lively expreſſed by God himſelf. <hi>Haſt thou given the Horſe ſtrength? haſt thou cloathed his neck with thunder? Canſt thou make him afraid as a Graſhopper? his noſtrils are terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoyceth in his ſtrength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the Sword. The quiver ratleth againſt him:</hi> he ſwalloweth the ground with firceneſs, he ſaith among the Trumpets, ha, ha; in which diſcription, you may ſee how furiouſly and dangerouſly he ruſheth into the Battle for he ruſheth upon the Pikes, and deadly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thus young people are apt, to ruſh on in ſinful ways, <hi>Furioſus juvenibus animi habitus.</hi> Tho God hedge in their way with Thorns, they break through all; as <hi>Balaam</hi> would on, tho there was a drawn Sword in the way. So Youth is prone to this mad fury, in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing on, tho God hath laid many bars in ſins way, as Majeſtracy, Miniſtry, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the occular demonſtrations of his Judgments upon other impenitent ſinners; theſe are all bars in their way, yet how rare is it, to ſee young ones reſtrained, and kept b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> are Brethren, inſtruments of Cruelty are in their Habitations. O my Soul come not thou into their Secret; unto their Aſſembly, mine Honour be not thou united, for in their anger they Slew a man, and in their ſelf will they digged down a Wall. Curſed be their Anger, for it was fierce, and their Wrath, for it was Cruel: It is to be obſerved, that the greater number of thoſe Malefactors that end their miſerable lives at <hi>Tiburn,</hi> are the younger ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their boiſterous luſts conſume them, that they ſcares live out half their days.</p>
            <p>C. <hi>Careleſs incogitancy, and want of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration,</hi> and laying to heart the moſt awful important matters of their Souls. There are three things (ſaith a great Writer) that are chief ruiners, and deſtroyers of Souls. Namely, 1. want of conſideration, and ſelf reflexion. 2. Infidelity, 3. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſs; but eſpecially want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The firſt of theſe, which Youth are exceeding guilty of: How ſeldom do young people retire, and ſoberly inquire, what their State and Condition God wards is? whether it be a ſtate of Nature or Grace? whether God be reconciled, and ſin pardoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas, young people are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

led by ſenſe, extending their thoughts no further, than juſt what is before them, though they live, and move, and have their Being in God: are always under his all-ſeeing Eye; yet he is not all their thoughts, tho he will bring them to Judgment, for all they do, yet they think not of it<hi>:</hi> This evidently appears in the advice the Holy Ghoſt giveth young ones: in the 11. of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. its true, all men naturally are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate about theſe things; but young ones are averſe to the thoughts of God, their Soul, Death and Judgment<hi>:</hi> becauſe the remembrance of theſe things, would damp their youthful ſenſual Delights, and Pleaſures, and adminiſter trouble to their minds, againſt which that age of life hath an irreconcileable enmity; and hence it is, that the vanities, and fooleries of this world, out way Chriſt, Heaven, and eternal Life. O did young ones but ſeriouſly conſider, and bend their thoughts cloſe to thoſe rouzing Doctrines and truth, as they are repreſented in the word of God: Their undone ſtate by Nature, and the peril of Hell and Damnation, they are in each moment, whilſt they delay Converſion, and flying for refuge to a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Jeſus; ſurely it would render the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of fleſhly pleaſures, <hi>jejune,</hi> and vain, and prove an excellent means to awaken them to Repentance, ere the day of Gods Patience be ended<hi>:</hi> which brings me to the

fourth &amp; next ſin young people are prone to.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Delaying of Religion,</hi> ſaying, They are yet young, and its time enough, though young People are often told, how much more dubious, and difficult their Repentance, and turning to God will be hereafter, then now, ſuppoſing their Lives ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to them. Yet (without the breach of Charity) one may ſay, ſcarce one of many Hundreds, but delay and neglect a preſent complyance with thoſe repeated Calls of God to Converſion; when, in the mean time, their Youthful Luſts, their Games, and Sports, call them, and find a quick and ready Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and Cloſure. <hi>David</hi>'s great Care was to ſet about the Work of Religion, while he was under the firſt, and early calls thereunto, 119 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60 I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments. But how rare is it to ſee, young Perſons (whom the Devil lays Siege to, endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that it is time enough, when they are older, to ſleep their thoughts in ſuch a melancholly Subject as Religion is) to follow his example.</p>

10. Another Sin that youth is prone to, is keeping ill Company, that Soul ruining ſnare of Satan's, which hath ſlain its thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, as being the foundation and inlet to all manner of wickedneſs. O how many hopeful young ones have been ſpoiled in the very bud, by the infectious influences of vile Company; whence is that advice of the Wiſe-man's in the 1ſt. of <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>My Son if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not,</hi> walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy feet from their Path. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith elſewhere of the ſteps of the ſtrange Woman, we may ſay of the ſteps of wicked company, they take hold of Hell, it is a new link in the Chain that faſteneth damnation to you, it is like tying a Milſtone about your necks, that will pull you both Soul and Body into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea of Gods Wrath, from whence there is no recovery. O young ones, you will find it one of the hardeſt things that is, when once you are engag'd in evil Company, to diſenthral your ſelves again: little do you know where it will lead you, it will inſenſibly harden you and bring you to a reprobate mind, it will <hi>vaſtare conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam,</hi> lay waſt your Conſciences, and ſo ſeat you in the Chair of the Scorners; and then the next ſtep is Hell. Ah! how many young ones, when firſt they have engaged in evil company, and ſet out with them, have been
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39105:17"/>
a little ſtartled and affrighted at their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutory Oathes (for <hi>nemo repente fit turpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus)</hi> as <hi>Juven.</hi> ſpeaks: yet after a while frequenting ſuch company they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt irrecoverably ingulfed into thoſe prodigious ſins, that themſelves could not have believed they ſhould ever adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on; ſuch an Emblem of Hell is ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that (without the breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) one may ſay that none continue in the one while they live, but inevitably fall into the other when they dye, and ſo their ſteps take hold of Hell, where the worm dyeth not, and fire is not quenched; where their fellowſhp in ſin will be turned into a miſerable fellowſhip of flames, where an holy and juſt God will do that, <hi>viz.</hi> damn them, which they in their merry meeting have ſo often called upon him to do; and the Devil will take that, <hi>viz.</hi> their Souls, which they have ſo freely and frequently given him.</p>
            <p>11. Another ſin whereunto youth are much addicted, is Lying, a ſin that ſeemeth to be contemporary with ſpeech in young Children; that as ſoon as their earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents teach them to ſpeak, their helliſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, learns them to lye; that as ſoon as the one learns them to go on Earth, the other learns them to go to Hell, hence theſe two are joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that 58. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. Speaking of young
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39105:17"/>
ones, they go aſtray from the Womb tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lies. This is a ſin, that all, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially young ones are exceedingly prone to, whereby Satan leads them captive at his will, to make them his Vaſſals: Look there young people! there are ſeveral ſins that are (as I may ſay) the very off-ſpring and Progeny of Satan, and in acting of them, a ſinner reſembles the Devil, as a Child the Father: For inſtance, Pride, it's called their condemnation of the Devil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. an angry paſſionate ſpirit it's ſtiled giving place to the Devil, 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 26, 27. the like one may ſay of this ſin of Lying, in the 8. <hi>John,</hi> and the cloſe of the 44. <hi>v.</hi> the Devil is called a lyer, and the Father of Lies, and in the 5. of the <hi>Acts</hi> 3. Satan is there ſaid to fill <hi>Ananias</hi> his heart to lie againſt God, which ſheweth that where there is a lie in the Tongue, there is the Devil filling of the Heart, ruling in Children of diſobedience; hence <hi>James</hi> ſaith 4. chap. and the 6. <hi>v.</hi> that it ſets all on fire of Hell. O how great is the power that Satan acquireth in young people by this ſin, it gives him that which he ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires; namely, a ſpiritual poſſeſſion of Souls, as a man poſſeſſeth and dwells in his Houſe, and there it is he learneth young ones that maſter-piece in the Black Art, to call Evil Good, and Good Evil, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the fact when they have committed ſin,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39105:18"/>
as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 25. thy Servant (ſaid lying <hi>Gehazi)</hi> went no whether; thus <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons, after they had wickedly ſold their Brother, come with a plauſible Tale (tho a palpable lye) to their Father, we found this bloody Garment in the Field, but whoſe it is we know not, 37. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>12. Another Sin, young ones are given to, is neglect of Relative duties, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and obeying their Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is a ſin peculiar to young people, and there are but few that eſcape the guilt of it. Hence have Miniſters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Fathers, almoſt every Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Bills of complaint, like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Roll, filled with lamentation, put into our hands, begging our earneſt Prayers for rebellious and diſobedient Children and Servants: Though the juſtice of God is ordinarily manifeſt in the execution of his threatned Judgments upon Children of <hi>Belial</hi> even in this Life: yet alas, how ſeldom do young people take and improve ſuch awful, awakening warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly? How common is it for Children, yea, when grown up, and their Parents grown old, to ſet light by them, and to ſpeak Sawcily and Contemptuouſly of them, and to them, behaving themſelves proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rudely before them, as if they were their equals; a practice moſt vile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of Nature, and always (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39105:18"/>
to the Scripture) entaileth a Curſe upon ſuch unnatural Children, 27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. <hi>Curſed be he that ſetteth light by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his Mother: and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi> The puniſhment that the Heathens inflicted on ſuch, was, to few them in a Sack with a Dog, Cat, Viper and Ape, (an Emblem of unnaturalneſs) and ſo drown them together, and the puniſhment that the Law of God in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> did aſſign to a rebellious Son, was to be ſtoned to Death<hi>:</hi> 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. If a man have a ſtubborn and rebellious Son, which will not obey the voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother, then ſhall they lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the Elders of the City, and all the men of the City ſhall ſtone him with ſtones till he dye. And it is obſervable, now under the Goſpel, how the holy and wiſe Povidence of God ordinarily ſets a mark upon diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, either in imbittering their lives with a ſucceſſion of miſeries and vexations here, or ſuffering them to fall by an untimely Death.</p>
            <p>13. Another Sin Youth is prone to, is Sabbath breaking; a day which uſually young people meet together upon, to walk abroad in the Fields, and take their pleaſure, and run into all exceſs of Riot, Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, acting their filthy luſts, drinking Healths, playing at Cards, Dancing, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39105:19"/>
and ſometimes Quarrelling, Fighting, Thieving, Robbing of Orchards and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and thus inverting that Day which God hath ſanctified, and appropriated to his own Honour and Service, and the ſaving of ſouls; to the ſervice of the Devil, and damning their own ſouls; ſure I am the whole Chriſtian world at this day groans under the tragical and bitter effects of this ſin, and he is nothing worthy of Eyes that weeps not to ſee whole droves running headlong to Hell through this breach, <hi>viz.</hi> the Breach of the Sabbath. Verily the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath more ſervice done on this day than on all the ſix beſides, and how deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the ſerious conſideration hereof, that the day which ſhould be Chriſt's, is the Devil's great harveſt of Souls, and that day which ſhould make joy in Heaven, by an addition to the Church, of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, ſhould ever prove Satans tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and Hells inlarging it ſelf beyond Meaſure, at the acceſſion of ſo vaſt a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sabbath-breakers into it.</p>
            <p>14. Another ſin that Youth is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prone to, is nouriſhing of vain hope, and flattering themſelves with the thought of long life, putting far away from them the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the evil Day. Young people account it, a kind of death to think of Death; the meditations, or tydings of it, are (like thoſe of the Judges coming to the Bench,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39105:19"/>
to Malefactors) entertained with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy; and when they cannot wholly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the items of it, out of their Conſciences, they will be ſure to ſet it a great way off: as thoſe bold ſinners did the Prophets Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the 12. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. the Viſion that he ſees, is for many days to come, and hence as that evil Servant, in the 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 48. when he ſaith in his heart, my Lord de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayeth his coming, he began to ſmite his fellow Servant, and to eat, and drink with the drunken; ſo young people, when they once drive off the thoughts of death, as far as they can from day to day, then they run a whoring from God, lay aſide Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, let looſe the reins of their Luſts, laugh at the tremendous threatnings of the Almighty. It is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrengthners of temptations to Luxury, Pride, and almoſt every ſin in the World, when ſinners are bold, to promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many years to come, as you may ſee in that 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 17, 18, 19. where our Saviour brings in that fooliſh rich man ſpeaking to his ſoul, after this manner, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, eat, drink, be merry, thou haſt goods laid up for many years.</hi> O young men, as you would eſcape the rebukes an angry God, and an exaſperated guilty Conſcience, promiſe not your ſelves long life, it is the ready way to Atheiſin and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy: whereas if you would always keep
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39105:20"/>
the eye of your mind open, to behold the ſpeedy approach of Death, and Judgment, as in <hi>rem preſentem,</hi> how admirably would it work, how ſerious in caſting up your ſouls accounts, and imploring of pardon and eternal Life would you be.</p>
            <p>15. Another of theſe youthful ſins is Pride, and vain Glory, which ſtands in an overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of our ſelves, with reference to the endowments of the Mind, or Body; ſuch as Wit, Parts, Beauty, Stature, Strength, Agility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Young ones have much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ignorance both of God, and themſelves; and hence they ſet themſelves as among the Stars in their own thoughts: if they have Parts, how prone are they to be proud of them, conceiting themſelves to have much more than indeed they have, and then above meaſure, admiring their own Wit, and ſtrength of parts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every one elſe ſhould admire them too, not conſidering that theſe mental gifts, without Grace, makes them more like the Devil, that abounds with endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this kind, and to be more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him (as malignant inſtrumentals) in promoting the ruin of mens ſouls; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> told a great, but unſanctified Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>ornari a te diabolus quaerit,</hi> the Devil ſeeks to be honoured, and ſerved by thee: And you read in 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was more ſubtile than any other beaſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39105:20"/>
the Devil uſed that Creature to deſtroy mankind. Now this Pride of Intellectuals, is never more dangerous, than when it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates upon Religion, and Souls affairs; and there are none more obnoxious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, than young people, a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge maketh them think they are fit to be Preachers preſently: whereas the old, and experienced Chriſtian, with trembling cryeth out, Lord, who is ſufficient for theſe things. Young ones, for want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with, and experience of the wickedneſs, and deceitfulneſs of their own hearts, are apt to think that they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Grace; <hi>Paul,</hi> a young man, was highly conceited of his good eſtate in Religion and ſpiritual matters, till the commandment came in the power of it, and revived in him a ſight and ſenſe of his curſed and ſinful eſtate by nature. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. And ſo the young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. chap. 20. <hi>All theſe have I done, what lack I yet.</hi> O young man remember, this ſpiritual Pride, is like the flye in the pot of Oyntment, make all to ſtink, if you over-value your ſelves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, you may ſoon undo your ſelves, and fall into the ſnare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Devil. This was the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> forbids the chooſing of a young beginner in Religion to the work of the Miniſtry: Not a Novice, leſt he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39105:21"/>
ſhould be lifted up with Pride. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Paul</hi> was a wiſe man, he well knew the ſubtilties of Satan, and the want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in young ones, would ſoon inſnare them, and betray them into the hands of this ſin. And then with reſpect to Pride in bodily endowments, as Beauty, Strength, Stature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas, how is the Youth of the preſent Age grown monſtrous herein? Never did Pride ride in ſuch ſtate, when it went abroad in the Streets of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as at this day it doth in this Nation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was born, and in this City wherein I now breathe. Alas, what wandering eyes, wanton dreſſes, fooliſh faſhions, apiſh imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, extravagant waſhings, profane patching, in a word, a practical devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the vile Body, that is but a fine skin full of filth, Flegm, Choler and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, abounds in this City: O the Arts, Studies, Pains, among us all for the neatify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, priding, pampering this piece of earth, that e're long will be meat for the Worms. O young people, what will a white skin, or ſtrength of Limbs, or a roſie Complexion ſignifie, when God rebuketh man for ſin, his beauty will conſume as a Moth. 39. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. One fit of an Ague can alter thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or a viſitation with the Small Pox, can change it into its contrary.</p>
            <p>16. Another ſin Youth is ordinarily prone to is quenching and ſtifling the holy motions
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39105:21"/>
of Gods Spirit: This more eſpecially they are liable to, that are the ſeed of the Righteous, and that dwell among thoſe, whoſe chief ſcope and aim is to promote your Converſion by their daily Prayers, Inſtructions, and holy examples. Such young ones, as are thus educated in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Families, and uſed to a conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance (through the care of their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents or Maſters) on the means of Grace, both publick and private; they do meet with innumerable inward motions of the ſpirit of God, ſtriving in, and with them, they lie more obvious to the Lords grace; and I am perſwaded that there is not one to be found among theſe, that are come to years of underſtanding, but what muſt own the truth of this. But oh, the woful oppoſition, that is commonly made by young ones againſt theſe holy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and illapſes of the bleſſed ſpirit; they are uſually like the ſparks falling into a Sea of water: when they are at a Sermon, how many knocks, and ſecret jogs, touches of Heart, and Conſcience, do they meet with, to conſider ſoberly about their ſpiritual and everlaſting ſtate. But what through the ſubtilty of Satan and the love of fooliſh mirth, and pleaſures, and vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preſently as ſoon as they return they loſe all, quench thoſe begun convictions, and juſt were it if the abuſed ſpirit ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39105:22"/>
depart for ever and ſtrive no more. Be aſſured young people, you cannot ſin, at ſo cheap a rate, as an old ſinner, that never had the heavenly gales, breathings, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, motions to converſion, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and checks in ſinful courſes, as you have had. O it is this that accents Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel condemnation, <hi>that light is come, and men love darkneſs rather than light.</hi> 3. <hi>John</hi> 19. When becauſe light reproves, gauls the ſinner, therefore it is hated, this is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indeed. O ponder a while what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy of God, it is to your poor miſerable ſouls, to have the ſtrivings and negotiatings of the holy ſpirit of God. 147. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. he hath not dealt ſo with all of your ranks, and ſtanding: How many thouſands are let alone, like young <hi>Dagons?</hi> now to reſiſt theſe, and to ſin againſt the light, argueth ſuch a love to ſin, and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to God, as juſtly may place you in the forefront of deſperate ſinners.</p>
            <p>17. The next ſin Youth are prone to, is Atheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ridiculing ſerious Religion. The holy Apoſtle diſtinctly foretold, by a ſpirit of Propheſie, this very ſin, in the 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming;</hi> ſurely theſe are thoſe laſt days, wherein we live; and never did this ſin of Atheiſm, and deriding at goodneſs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39105:22"/>
obtain ſuch a vogue, till of late, in this irreligious Age; wherein the main Articles of the Chriſtian Faith are ſhaken in the minds of multitudes of young people. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath corrupted the minds of many, and diffuſed his venemous influence, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Pagan and Papal, but alſo through the Proteſtant and Reformed world too. O! what a world of infidelity, and Atheiſm is to be found in our Cities, and Countries, and would to God our Churches were free<hi>:</hi> but if we compare the lives of abundance of Profeſſors, with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Creed, really their profeſſion will ſcarce cover their Hypocriſie, and Atheiſm; though you ſhould exerciſe the largeſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. God, and Chriſt, the immortality of the Soul, Death, and Judgment, Heaven and Hell, are in their Creed, and they would condemn you for a rank Heretick, if you ſhould deny any of theſe Doctrines; But a little obſervation of their ſenſual lives will ſoon acquaint you with their vile and odious Hypocriſie and Atheiſm; while you behold in their lives, the great God diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, Chriſt vilified, Heaven condemned, and the Worlds vanities preferred before it, Hell ventured upon for the ſake of a pleaſing ſin. And among us there are a generation of young Wits ſprang up, that (that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they have had baptiſmal Water on their face, yet) arrived to that highth of ſin, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39105:23"/>
to tell the world, not only in their works but alſo in words, that Religion is a meer fancy, nothing but the melancholly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſome poor ſpirited men, that fooliſhly and fondly conceit of ſuch a thing as God lives, and of a Heaven prepared for thoſe that have it, and Hell for thoſe that want it, and then they ſcare, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright themſelves with thoſe buggbears, that their own fancies repreſent. And thus as the judicious <hi>Gurnal</hi> ſadly obſerves, <hi>(p.</hi> 298.) <hi>Some among us have dared to make it their boaſt, and glorying, that they have at laſt got from under the burthen of that Tyrant Conſcience, they can Swear and Drink, Whore, and what not, without any check, or remorſe.</hi> Time was when they were under the wing of their Parents, that they trembled at the hearing of ſuch guilt: But now entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Atheiſtical Clubs, and imbibing their principles, their Conſciences are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſilent, after they have been duck't ſo often for ſcolding, that they are Sermon poof, and laugh at the Notion of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and at Miniſters, who in the name of God threaten impenitent ſinners with it, and look upon them, as the verieſt fools, and mad Men in the World;—but know, that theſe will prove the worſt fools at laſt, yea, worſe by far, than <hi>David</hi>'s Fool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>The food hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God:</hi> That fool durſt only whiſper
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39105:23"/>
it, but theſe ſpeak it boldly and openly: Theſe declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not. To go about to confute theſe Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> would be a vain thing; we have <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, every Leaf therein is ſufficient. But theſe Sinners deride the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and ſo tho' one ſhould ariſe from the Dead, and come from Hell with the Flames of that burning Lake about his Ears, and tell them the Torments they endure; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they believe. Surely that ſuch a Generation not only of practical, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſhould be found in a Land, that hath enjoyed ſo much Goſpel-light, is a lamentation, and ought to be for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I may ſay as <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 2. chap. 12. v. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, at this, and be ye horribly afraid, be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Methinks it ſhould make our very Hearts to tremble, when we ſee ſuch curſed Weeds ſpring up in ſuch a Garden, that God hath taken ſuch pains withal; he is more than blind that doth not ſee, and ſo ſay, <hi>Stultorum plena ſunt omnia.</hi> Maſter <hi>Greenham</hi> feared rather <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> than <hi>Popery,</hi> would be <hi>England</hi>'s Ruin. The Lord affect your Heart, and mine with this Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Day we live in, namely the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing, and deriding the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſtiling it nothing but <hi>Fancy,</hi> or <hi>Faction, Pride,</hi> or <hi>Singularity.</hi>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:39105:24"/>
18. Another Sin the Youth of this Age, are much given to, is Swearing, Curſing, and taking the Holy and Reverend Name of God in vain. A Sin for which the Land mourns. There are two Kinds of it, both which young people are prone to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Uſing the Name of God unreverently in common talk, at every turn to ſay <hi>[O Lord, O God,</hi> or, <hi>God bleſs me,</hi> or, <hi>take me]</hi> this is taking God's Name in vain; and how many thouſands of little Children, as well as others, are guilty in this kind, almoſt at every word, toſſing that awful and holy Name about in their graceleſs mouths; which a world of Glorious Angels and glorified Spirits are magnifying continually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Horrid prodigious Oaths, not to be named without abhorrency, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13, 14 you read there that <hi>their Throat is an open Sepulchre, the poyſon of Aſps is under their Lips; whoſe Mouth is full of Curſing and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs.</hi> And certainly if ever the Youth of a Kingdom, were in danger of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Curſe of the Almighty, flaming out from the <hi>Mount Ebal</hi> of thoſe Scriptures; the Swearing Youth of this Kingdom is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 3, 4. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, What ſeeſt thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I anſwered, I ſee a flying Roll, the leng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:39105:24"/>
               <hi>cut off according to it. I will bring it forth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and it ſhall enter into the Houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by my Name, and it ſhall remain in the middle of his Houſe, and it ſhall conſume it, with the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Stones thereof.</hi> Whence you may note, that ſo long as this Sin remains unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, this Curſe remains and abideth on them, till it bring utter ruin upon them and their whole Eſtate. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. chap. 5. <hi>And I will come near to you in Judgment, and I will be a ſwift Witneſs againſt the Swearer, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Exodus 20. 7. <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltleſs, that taketh his Name in vain. Not guiltleſs</hi> (there is a <hi>Meioſis</hi> in thoſe words) that is, the Lord will be ſeverely avenged on ſuch. O the fearful eſtate, of not a few, but multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and whole troops of Children, and young ones, in this Land, in this City, in our Armies, in our Fleets, by reaſon of this Sin! who can number the Perſons, much leſs able are we to number the Oaths, the horrid Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations they uſe, that almoſt at every word call to God to Damn them, their Souls, their Blood? Wo to us, the moral Heathen would be aſhamed of us: Is it not time to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee a young Generation run with open Mouth upon Ruin, with their Mouth ſet againſt Heaven in Blaſphemies, and ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Vices as haſten their own Damnation, and threaten <hi>England</hi>'s Deſtruction; may not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39105:25"/>
we juſtly fear, that the bloody Oaths of the Land of our Nativity, may turn it into an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> i. e. a Field of Blood. In this Sin are wrapped both Parents and Children, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants, Officers and common Soldiers, Rich and Poor, and too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters with the People, the Buyer, &amp; the Seller. Verily if the Lord, who threatneth to be a ſwift Witneſs againſt the Swearer, ſhould now come among us, with his deſerved, as well as threatned Curſe, what ſcudding and crying to the Hills and Mountains to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, would there be! A Tree loaded with Boughs is fit for lopping; a Sinner loaded with Oaths, is fit to be hew'n down, &amp; caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell Fire. A Chimney furr'd with Soot, will take fire at laſt; a Sinner's mouth furr'd with Oaths, will at laſt, without Repentance, burn him with unquenchable Fire. O how little is this conſidered by our common Swearers; O young ones take heed of this Sin: young <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he was in a Swearing Court, he learn'd to ſwear the Court-Oath; viz. <hi>by the Life of Pharaoh,</hi> that was his Sin. But alas, in our Age it's become faſhionable, and a piece of Gentility to Swear by the <hi>Death, Wounds, Blood of Chriſt;</hi> Petty Oaths of <hi>Maſs, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Troth,</hi> which in former times were moſt ſeverely condemned by the good old <hi>Puritans:</hi> Now wo to us, we run to the higheſt form in the Devil's School, and commence Maſters of that Black Art of <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me's,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:39105:25"/>
and full-mouth'd Blaſphemies. Yea, and (the Lord be merciful to us) our little Children have learn't it as ſoon as they can ſpeak or waddle about Streets; the ſound whereof, hath often pierced my Heart, with my Ears<hi>:</hi> the good Lord of Heaven and Earth baniſh it out of our Iſland, or it will (I fear) ſink us. We are encompaſſed about with two Oceans, ſaith one, an Ocean of Waters, and an Ocean of Mercies; And let me add a third, namely an Ocean of Oaths, which if not reformed, will bring a fourth, viz. an Ocean of Miſeries. Some ſay Words are but Wind: it's true; but it is ſuch a Wind as will blow a Soul to Hell, if Grace prevent it not.</p>
            <p>19. Another Sin that young people are notoriouſly given to, and guilty of, is Idle, and Sinful ſquandring away their precious time; young People think that they have ſuch a profound, and full ſtock of time to come, that they have enough to ſpare and ſpend profuſely, and while away (as the Countrey Phraſe is) at preſent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make little or nothing of laviſhing out Hours and Days. You know perſons will ſpend prodigally out of a full Purſe, who would be very ſparing, if they knew they had but a little, or were like to come to Poverty. Thus Youth fooliſhly fancy that, becauſe ſome have lived to ſee and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil 70, or 80 Years, therefore they muſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39105:26"/>
do ſo too: and when they have been thus kind to themſelves, in making ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of many Years to come; then they turn Prodigals of their time, and caſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as a thing of nought, and with it caſt away all care of their Souls, and loiter out their Morning-Seaſon, at that profuſe rate, as if they were never to be called to account for that, or that God only deſign'd, and aſſign'd the Evening of their Life, that laſt, and worſt part of time, to be redeem'd, and carefully improved, for their better part their precious Souls. But how miſerably cheated are young People herein, as appeareth by thoſe many awakening inſtances, of our Lord's coming to young Ones, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Life, a time, when they leaſt of all looked for him, and then how have they cried out; O precious time! more worth than a World, when it cometh to the laſt Sand at the bottom of the Glaſs: O then what a mercy would they eſteem it, if God would truſt them once again with Time. O young People, think of this the next Temptation to Idleneſs or carnal Eaſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Pleaſures that returneth, and frown upon it give it the ſame entertainment, as you would a Thief that comes to kill, or rob you; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Souls and Eternity are imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued in your youthful Seaſons<hi>:</hi> and ſurely the conſideration of the worth of your Souls, and the aſtoniſhing nature of Eternity, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39105:26"/>
force enough to make the extravagant laviſhers of time, to become the moſt thrifty Husbands of it, as one of the moſt precious things in the World. O young Man, thou haſt now a rich Price put into thy hands; doſt thou want a Heart to improve it? Know thou, that ere long thou mayeſt have a Heart, but no price of precious Time in thine Hand. We are fallen into a looſe and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Age.</p>
            <p>20. Uncleanneſs is another Sin, that Youth is prone to, this is the breach of the Seventh Commandment. In which Commandment there is a two fold Uncleanneſs forbidden, <hi>firſt,</hi> mental, or the uncleanneſs of the Mind; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> corporal, or that of the Body. Now Youth is commonly addicted to both theſe, and to watch, and wait for opportunities to fulfil their impure Luſts; hence in the 7th of the <hi>Prov.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. you read: <hi>At the Window of my Houſe, I looked through the Caſement, and behold among the Simple Ones, I diſcerned among the Youths, a Young Man void of underſtanding, paſſing by the way to her Houſe, and he went near her Corner, in the twilight in the Evening, and behold there met him a Woman with the attire of an Harlot, his Eye waited for the twilight, and in the twilight he was taken by her;</hi> as you may ſee in the 23 verſe. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh 2 Epiſt. 2 chap 4. verſ. of <hi>Eyes that are full of Adultery.</hi> It's true indeed, that this Sin hath
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39105:27"/>
the ſame common principle as other Sins, <hi>viz.</hi> a corrupt Nature; it is ſeated in the Heart, there is the Fountain of it, 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murthers, Adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. But yet the Eye is the Heart's chief agent to eſpy out objects, and to find out and fetch in Fuel for this Sin: And as the Heart ſometimes ſets the Eye on work to prole, and range about for a beautiful Bait; ſo the Eye ſometimes meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Objects, ſets the Heart on work yea, all a fire, or in a flame of adulterou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39105:28"/>
Youth, and more eſpecially ſuch of them as have not been catechiſed, nor by the care and endeavours of Parents and Maſters, been well grounded in the Principles of Religion, for want of which they have eaſily been ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and led into Errours by ſuch as lie in wait to deceive. And wo to us, are we not miſerably over-run at this day with perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Errours? contending moſt unchriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our own Devices, and Parties, crying out, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt,</hi> when more truly it may be ſaid, Lo here is Satan, and there is Satan, transforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of Light, and through his ſubtilty corrupting the minds of many among us from that ſimplicity which is in Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. Hence the Apoſtle was fill'd with a Godly jealouſie and fear leſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould be removed and carried away from Chriſt. The good Lord humble us for our ſwervings from the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which is Love out of a pure Heart and of a good Conſcience, and Faith unſeigned, and for our turning aſide ſo much to vain Janglings. Errour has got the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant in the Cockloft of ſome mens Brains, and there it ſo inebriates and infatuates them, that (like the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of old, who under the pretence of New Light and Revelation, fanſied themſelves admirably Holier than others, ſo) theſe conceit themſelves to be more Evangelical and refined, becauſe more

airy and notional, and then they are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to ſpend all their Zeal in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent obtruding their own ſtarving and ſleepy Opinions upon others, which indeed ſerve for no other end, but to devour all the Life and Subſtance of Religion, as the lean Kine, in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s dream, did eat up the Fat. How audaciouſly have ſome by their looſe and lewd Pens, and Tongues, argued againſt the merit and Deity of the Son of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided the Spirit of Prayer, advanc'd Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the works of the Law in the room of Chriſt, boaſting of the ſufficiency of man's power to ſave himſelf<hi>:</hi> and then on the other hand, how induſtrious have ſome been to contrive a ſmooth and eaſie way for corrupt Nature to come to Heaven, without the toilſome labour of ſubduing our Luſts, and Sinful Affections; as if now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel the holy Law of God was no Rule for us to walk by, but laid flat (like an old Hedge) that Sinners may at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure trample on it, and walk over it<hi>:</hi> and that to be ſolicitous about Sanctification and Inherent Holineſs, is but a legal buſineſs, and not influential to a Chriſtian's Peace, nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential of his Pardon; but that now the main deſign of the Goſpel at the firſt flight, is to mount Sinners ſo high as to poſſeſs them with a gallant triumphant Confidence, and ſtrong, gigantick Perſwaſion of the Everlaſting Decrees of God, that he hath Elected, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39105:29"/>
loved them, and that their Sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that they need not trouble themſelves about Repentance, and the Law of God written or copied out on the Table of their Hearts, and the Inhabitation of the Spirit of Grace in their Souls, as a Principle of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life. O how ſad a ſight is it to ſee the Field of the Church thus over-run with Tares, and the Houſe of God filled with Smoke! it's enough to fill us with fear that the Fire of God's Judgment is beginning there. Now this being the ſad genius of our Times, there are none more apt to take in the infection, than Youth, upon the account of that levity and curioſity that uſually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth that Age. Young people have itch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing Ears, and are very credulous, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to take what they hear on truſt than to trouble themſelves and take pains to try what conformity ſuch and ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions have to the unerring Rule, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Unſtable Youth is given to change, and like a Reed is ſoon ſhaken, or like young and freſh Meat in hot weather, which is moſt in danger of being Fly-blown. And Satan he is that old Serpent that is moſt buſie to blaſt and poyſon their hopeful Spring; he is that myſtical Fox that is ever<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>more endeavouring to ſpoil our Vine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

danger is there, of an impure copulation, between the young man's Mind and Errour, eſpecially when in the one there is a pleaſing Vagrancy and Vanity, like <hi>Dinah</hi> gadding abroad; and in the other a poyſoning Energy. And alas how is this abundantly verified by woful experience at this day; ſhoals have been perverted, inſomuch that our Land is like a Lazar-Houſe or Hoſpital the Plague is begun among. O that there were ſome <hi>Aaron</hi> among us, to take a Cenſer and put on Incenſe, and go in quickly, and make an atonement; to allude to that 16 <hi>Numb.</hi> 46.

Thy Luſts will breed ſuch ſottiſhneſs, and ſtupidity in thy Conſcience, as will moſt certainly hinder thy Converſion. Conſcience is a Witneſs, but if that witneſs be dumb, who ſhall tell thee of thy Sin, and danger? Conſcience is a Schoolmaſter, to direct, and correct; but if that Schoolmaſter be blind, or craz'd, or lie like one ſtark mad, or dead, who (I pray) ſhall admoniſh you, and adminiſter reproof to you? alas, we ſpeak without you, it's Conſcience that is as a thouſand Witneſſes within you; and if that be like an Idol, what hope of Converſion? Conſcience is the Candle of the Lord within thee, and if this be put under a Buſhel, how eaſily may the Devil hurry thee blind fold to Hell and Damnation. Conſcience is appointed of God to be that to the Soul, as the Pilot is to the Ship amidſt Rocks, Sands; ſuppoſe now that the Pilot have either loſt his Compaſs to ſteer by, or has no ſupernal light to make

            <p>3dly. Theſe youthful Luſts, they increaſe that natural rebellion that is in the Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt turning to God; and ſo they indiſpoſe the Soul to Converſion<hi>:</hi> the Will is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent part, or power of the reaſonable Soul: it is compar'd, by ſome, to the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> in the Heavens, that carrieth all the inferiour Orbs away in its own motion; or like a Queen ſitting upon its Throne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing its dominion over the other parts of the Soul<hi>:</hi> And as Conſcience hath ſeveral offices, and acts, ſo hath the Will. The Schoolmen marſhall up ſeveral; as. Volition, and that either abſolute, and efficacious, or more languid, and imperfect<hi>:</hi> (2.) Fruition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (3.) Intention<hi>:</hi> (4.) Election<hi>:</hi> (5.) Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I ſhall only ſhew you how impoſſible a ſaving and found Converſion of the Soul can ever be, except the Will, this ſuperiour faculty in the Soul, be brought into ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:39105:37"/>
to Chriſt: and then ſhew you how youthful Luſts not only hinder that ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Will to Chriſt, but ſtrengthen its reſiſtance and rebellion againſt it.</p>
            <p>(1) How impoſſible a thing Converſion is without the Will be brought into obedience to Chriſt. When God firſt created Man upon Earth, this noble part of the Soul, the Will, was in a moſt perfect and holy conformity to the Will of God; but ſince Sin entred, the Will is ſo far fallen from its primitive honour, that <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>voluntas tua infernus eſt tuus,</hi> that mans Will now is his Hell; of a Virgin, ſhe is now become like a polluted Whore; So that naturally we will not come to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. We will not be made clean, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 27. We will walk after our own Devices, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 12. Now how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a thing is it, that there ſhould be a through Converſion, till this natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the Will is ſlain, and removed; for the Will is the man, and it's everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, and will be found ſo, <hi>That his you are whom you willingly obey, whether it be of Sin unto Death, or Obedience unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Rom. 6. 16.</p>
            <p>(2.) Youthful Luſts yielded unto, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that natural averſeneſs and obſtinacy that is in our Will, and ſo it indiſpoſeth the Soul to Converſion. We read that <hi>Whoredom and Wine take away the Heart,</hi> in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 11. Why, may ſome ſay, was the Heart ſet upon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39105:37"/>

In Prayer, thy affections ſhould be fixed on God in Chriſt, as the ſole object of thy Love, Delight, and filial Fear: But are they ſo? doſt thou draw nigh to God as thy exceeding joy? tell me, young man, where are thy <hi>Bethels?</hi> thy <hi>Penuels?</hi> I doubt, upon a ſerious review, it will be found quite otherwiſe, that vain thoughts have lodged in thy mind, and that ſwarms of noiſome Luſts have been tumbling up and down the dead Sea of thy Soul in time of Prayer. Ah, how little of love to God, hatred of Sin, anſwerable to their nature, have poſſeſſed your Souls in duty: if any pious ſtirrings of Affections have been, how
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39105:41"/>
ſhort a ſtay have they made; how many more ambitious, wanton, covetous or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Thoughts have been jumbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with them I appeal to you. Is it not enough to change that Prayer into Sin, wherein thy God hath been lodged with a crew of viperous Luſts, or rather wherein thy Affections have been committing ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fornication with their Idols, or have been <hi>(Dinah</hi> like) gadding abroad with the Fools Eyes to and fro to the ends of the Earth. Now upon enquiry whence this comes about, if thou ſearch impartially, and caſt the lot right, it will appear that the Arch-Agent of, and in all this is thy minion Luſt, that Youth is under the power of<hi>:</hi> ſome complain of continual diſtractions in Prayer, their Minds are like the unquiet Waves of the Sea, up and down; their Affections unſtable, rambling up and down. Alas, the main reaſon of this woful poſture in Duty, is their unmortified Luſts; and it is very obſervable that the more proviſion you make for the Fleſh, to fulfil it in its luſts, the more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and tyranny it will have over your Thoughts and Affections in holy Duties: and is ſuch a Prayer ever like to iſſue in thy Converſion, wherein thy Affections have been under the vile umpire and influence of thy Luſts? It may rather be called a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to thy Luſts, than to God. There was <hi>Jehu,</hi> what ardent and zealous affection
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39105:41"/>
did he ſeem to have in the Service and Cauſe of God, when he cryed out, <hi>Come ſee my Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> But what was it that influenced and moved his affections? it was not the Glory of God, but the luſt of Vain-glory and Self-advancement. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirms this, that many in their youth have had ſhews of great affection in their Profeſſion of Godlineſs, who have after a while fell away, and become at laſt as ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſtupid about Heavenly things as any prophane one in the world.</p>
            <p>O young People, thoſe Luſts you ſerve, will have ſuch an ill influence on your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as that they will become like wild Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to tear your Souls in pieces. O curſed Luſts, how unſpeakable is that thraldom they lay our affectionate part under, that when thy Affections ſhould be like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s fiery Chariot, to mount thy Soul up to Heaven, they ſhould (through thy luſt) be like the Wheels of a <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Chariot, furiouſly to hurry thy Soul to Hell. Our affections were planted in us for this end, to facilitate, and make our acceſs to God, to become eaſie, pleaſant, and delightful to our Soul; but, O miſerable change, they now are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, (through thy unmortified Luſts) they are like Clogs, Chains, and Fetters, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Soul's approach to God.

Converſion is ſet forth in Scripture, to be the Lord's own workmanſhip.

Hence Miniſters are called <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fathers;</hi> not that there is any inherent power in either the Word it ſelf, or him that preacheth it, but from the Spirit of God, whoſe Inſtruments we are, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>are mighty through God to the pulling down</hi>

And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>We have this Treaſure in Earthen Veſſels, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God:</hi> So then ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth, any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> Not any thing in a way of efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, only inſtrumentally; as a Pen is the Inſtrument, but it's the Hand that writes: ſo the Word preached, and the diſpenſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now then to raiſe the Argument, and build upon this Foundation that I have laid; if the principal efficient Cauſe and means o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But youthful luſts yielded to, and ſerved, do moſt certainly thus provoke

O when a poor Sinner cometh to God by Chriſt, and knocketh for converting Grace, out of a ſenſe of its damned, undone condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if he prevail not, and cryeth out, O thou moſt patient (tho' provoked) God, it's matter of admiration, that thou ſuffereſt ſuch a Viper as I am to live and breath in thy common Air: O pity me a Hell-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinner, for the ſake of thy dear Son, who made ſatisfaction by his bitter Death and Paſſion to thy Juſtice, and grant me this favour in thy ſight, the forgiveneſs of my Sins, and the Spirit of Grace, to ſubdue the power of my luſts, and to renew me in Soul and Body<hi>:</hi> O Father of Mercies, if thou do not ſhew me this favour and mercy, I ſhall live thine enemy, and ſhall, I know not how ſoon, dye miſerably, to mine own eternal undoing.

After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is this Exerciſe to be performed, and it brings God's Inſtitution, it is under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Bleſſing, and many can ſet to their ſeals, that their labour herein hath not been in vain, with reference to Repentance and Converſion. Now giving way to youthful
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:39105:53"/>
luſt, directly oppoſeth Converſion, both as it withdraws you from it, and withereth your Soul in the performance of it. Alas, when your Luſts grow clamorous, and you obſequious to them, they will breed in you an averſation &amp; oppoſition to Prayer<hi>:</hi> you will not find a Heart inclined to, but wretchedly diſ-inclined from God, which is a ſad caſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and to have a hard Heart, that cannot Pray (was the note of an Eminent Saint, and Servant of God now aſcended) compleateth a Soul's miſery; it pulls down fury and deſtruction upon the Heads of ſuch; as you may ſee in the 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. O what care ſhould you take to preſerve your comfortable acceſs to God by Chriſt every day: our Life is a worthleſs thing without it; hence in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. the Apoſtle doth ſo earneſtly preſs Husbands and Wives to exemplary walking, <hi>that your Prayers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be not hindred.</hi> Now there is nothing ſo much hindereth Prayer, as giving way to your Luſts; for by theſe you provoke God to ſtop his Ear, and withdraw and ſtand at a diſtance from you, and by theſe you irritate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of your own Hearts againſt God, and cauſe it to ſtand at a greater diſtance from God: as <hi>Adam</hi> when he yielded to eat of the forbidden Fruit, he grew ſhy of God. Woful experience evinceth this, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have given way to Pride, or Paſſion, or Luſt, or ſinful Pleaſures in the day, they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:39105:53"/>
can't tell how to go and pray to God at night, or look him in the Face, with any comfort or confidence<hi>:</hi> when Conſcience upbraideth, doſt thou pray, O vile Hypocrite! haſt thou been kindling the Fire of his Wrath all day, and doſt thou think to obtain his favour all of a ſudden? When thou haſt been grieving his Spirit, and tearing open the wounds of the bleſſed Jeſus, by thy wilful ſinning againſt Light, and Convictions, how canſt thou expect the Comforter ſhould come to thee? If a man were to plead for his Life at the Bar, would he be ſo mad as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper himſelf with ſtrong Drink before hand; this were the ready way to loſe him his Life: and ſo it is the ready way to loſe your Converſion, wherein ſtands the Life of your Souls, if you intoxicate them with the ſtupefying Vapours, that ariſe from your fulfilled Luſts. It was holy Mr. <hi>Dod</hi>'s ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That either Praying would make us leave off Sinning, or Sinning would make us leave off Praying.</hi> And then pray obſerve, your Luſts tend to the manifeſt withering, cripling your Souls in the performance of this duty: It cuts and clips the Soul's wings in Prayer, and then down you fall, and ſink as a dead thing in Prayer. O therefore flee youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſt, or they will render Prayer no more than a dead empty Formality; and how waſte and deſolate a thing is that? it will be like ſome Diſeaſe in the Body, that converts all the Food, that ſhould

nouriſh Nature, to the feeding themſelves, and ſo macerate, and miſerably conſume the Body; or like ſome Thief, or Thieves in a Houſe, the Maſter's Goods and Stock con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually waſte and conſume<hi>:</hi> and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Viper is in their own Boſoms. Thus, young men, your Luſts will bring leanneſs into your Souls in Prayer. O young man, doſt thou find the Lord gone in Prayer, no diſcoveries of himſelf, but a great eſtranged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: wouldſt thou know the cauſe? read that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>They were eſtranged through their Luſts.</hi> Be aſſured of this, there is a Heart-league, and ſome youthful Luſt or other, which lays an embargo upon the Soul, and arreſts the profit of all thy Prayers Suppoſe a man did know, and ſee his own Wife loving and cleaving to ſome other man; would not this ſpoil the comfort of their communion? as we that are reaſonable Creatures, don't love to be among unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Brutes in the Wilderneſs, or the Living to be among the Tombs and the Dead: So a holy God regards not the Prayers, will not be enquired of, nor ſpoke with, by thoſe who regard their Luſts in their Hearts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Why have we faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thou regardeſt not?

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39105:54"/>
whence is this? Oh young man, ſure there is ſome betwitching Luſt or other ſucks thee. As if I ſaw a Plant or Tree that is daily watered, and has no want of outward means of flouriſhing, and bearing Fruit; yet withereth, and dyeth away, be ſure there is ſome Worm in the Root corroding it. I have heard of late many young People pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out their Complaints after this manner, <hi>Alas, I have been ſeeking, and knocking at the door of Ordinances, Prayer, Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but have not, find not, feel not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies come in: I am like thoſe that had been toiling all Night, and catch nothing. Oh ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was my Heart ſo dead in Duty,</hi> ſaith one<hi>: ſo ſtraitned, and ſhut up,</hi> ſaith another! And hence ſome cry out, <hi>To what purpoſe ſhould we wait any longer? What profit is there in Praying to the Almighty? What ſweetneſs in Ordinances? What is Chriſt more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> Now, I pray whence is this? What is Chriſt a barren Wilderneſs? a Land of Darkneſs? a broken Ciſtern? a Field with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Treaſure? a Well without Water? a Cloud without Rain? What is the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to hear? and pitty a poor diſtreſſed Sinner, that comes and makes its moan to him? And is it in vain to ſeek him? Oh no! Chriſt is precious, God is gracious, the hearer of Prayers, the rewarder of ſuch as diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek him.

But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Luſt, and enticed; then when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when it is finiſhed, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Death.</hi> And hence our bleſſed Lord teacheth us <hi>to watch and pray, that we enter not into Temptation;</hi> that is to ſin; for in this ſenſe is the word uſed in Scripture, as <gap reason="foreign">

Conſider the Impiety and Wickedneſs of Delaying, for it doth in effect ſpeak thus to God, The real love and delight of my Soul is in my Luſts, I deſire thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſtay for my Repentance till here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and by no means to puniſh me while I ſhall be provoking and diſhonouring thee in the tract of my youthful days; give me leave to be a faithful Servant to divers Luſts and Pleaſures while I have ſtrength and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and then when I grow impotent, and my Luſts turn me off, I pray thee to accept me, and grant me Heaven. O what monſtrous Blaſphemy and Impiety is there in ſuch a vile deportment towards the Bleſſed God, and pray is there not ſomething of this in every delay; it ſheweth evidently that thou preferreſt thy Luſts before him, yea, the Devil's ſervice before his.

What think you, will an earthly King bear it, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending below himſelf to ſpare and ſhew mercy to obſtinate Traytors, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. It is alſo to be conſidered how wickedly theſe delays do vilifie the Grace of our dear Redeemer, who though he was rich with the Riches of the Deity, he thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet ſuch was his amazing Grace, that for our ſakes he became poor with the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our humanity; he took upon him the form of a Servant, he was a Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and acquainted with Griefs, and here in the days of his Fleſh endured the contradiction of Sinners, the temptations of Satan, the curſe of the Law, the bitter
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:39105:84"/>
wrath of God, and the accurſed death of the Croſs, and all this for Rebels, Enemies. O infinite condeſcenſion; and after all this is done, he comes a wooing to our Doors, and follows us up and down with the ſweet motions of his Spirit, and with the ſtrong motives of his Love, in dying for us: pleading, O Sinners, why will you dye? I am Jeſus who dyed for you, turn unto me, my Heart is towards you; what could I have done more for you to win you, to redeem you, than I have done. O remember how I was wounded for your Sins, Behold my Hands and Feet, reach hither thine Hand, put it into the hole in my ſide, look upon me in the Garden, and on the Croſs, and trace me there, when my Blood trickled down my weary Body, and ſee how I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you, and whether ever love was like mine to you. O that the Lord would pleaſe to make you ſenſible, young people, and cauſe you to apprehend the truth of this, that Chriſt doth really thus plead with you, to know the things of your Peace, now in this your day, and to flee your youthful Luſts without delay. And here I pray give me leave, without the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, to repreſent to you the impious nature of this Sin of delaying, as it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and contemning all this rich Grace and Love of bleſſed Jeſus. O young man, while thou delayeſt, thou trampleſt on
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39105:84"/>
Chriſt's precious Blood, thou embraceſt and openeſt to thy vile Luſts, and Chriſt is made to ſerve, to ſtand without in the mean while; is it not enough to provoke him in fury to be gone, and never return more till he come to ſentence thee, to <hi>go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed into everlaſting Fire?</hi> Young man, has not Chriſt's Blood a cry? does it not cry to Heaven for Mercy to poor Sinners? and does it not cry on Earth to Sinners, O ceaſe your enmity, throw down your weapons of hoſtility: O repent, repent, and I will appeaſe and quench the Flames of divine Wrath, that your Sins have kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now delays, ſo long as they laſt, are a direct oppoſition hereunto, it is equivalent with waging war againſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt; it is interpretatively a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the Devil againſt Chriſt. Young man, were you aware of this, O be aſſured the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> is in this, there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar enmity in Satan againſt the Blood of Chriſt, as it is a Sinner's ranſom, while him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is left bound with eternal Chains; hence he ſubtilly endeavoureth to ſtrengthen the confederacy with thy youthful Luſts by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent delays, which if he can effect, he knoweth it to be a direct compliance with him, to vilifie that healing Plaiſter of Chriſt's precious Blood; and how doth he inſult when he can prevail herein, to keep out Chriſt, notwithſtanding all his wooings,

               <p>Beſides, if you conſider the ſuſpition of an hereafter-Repentance; true Repentance is never too late, but late Repentance is ſeldom true; which might be abundantly argued, from the uſual experience of Sinners when they are ſick, O what Proteſtations do they then make of their Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but commonly return to Sin, as the Dog to the Vomit, when reſtored to health again: So that there is uſually great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs in Mens Sick-bed Repentances, by no means is it to be depended on. Surely it would be (compar'd with this) a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able folly for a Man to adventure upon Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe he hath heard there is a certain Antidote in the World to expel it, tho' he cannot tell whether he can get that Remedy or no; To what this is in the preſent Caſe:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39105:90"/>
It would be a piece of madneſs, that would be deſervedly unpardonable, to run the riſque and adventure of a death-bed Repentance; when you are told of the multitudes that periſh, to a very few that are ſaved, pray examine carefully what ſuch a Repentance is made up of; uſually it conſiſts in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate awakenings of natural Conſcience, upon the Sinner's Alarm to appear before that God to whom he has been a long time eſtranged, and againſt whom he has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a long and old Enmity; hereupon there ſprings up in his Breaſt a ſervile fear and dread of this holy and juſt God; hence the Sinner being ſtript of all Creature comforts and help, flies and cryes to God for pardon of his Sins, and deliverance from Hell, in great affrightment of Spirit, and O if God will ſpare, what manner of perſon he will be, and the like. Now pray judge righteous Judgment, and make a true eſtimate herein, many ignorant Wretches call this true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereas all this is but nature in miſery, crying for eaſe, which the verieſt Reprobate in the World may do, nay, can't but do, if Conſcience be awakened: here is no change of their hearts <hi>from darkneſs to light, and the power and love of ſin, to God and holineſs.</hi> Alas! let but theſe Men be put into their former ſtate of health and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again, and they would be the very ſame; a <hi>Balaam</hi> may come thus far to cry out, <hi>O</hi>

               <head>The next Sin that I ſhall direct Young Ones to flee, is, <hi>An eager purſuit of ſenſual and ſinful Pleaſures, their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe more than God,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>I Have ſhewed you already, how ſtrongly Youth is bent upon Pleaſures, Sports, Games, Feaſts, Paſtimes. O! Young Men love theſe as their Lives, and ſome will as ſoon part with their Lives, as with their youthful Pleaſures; they have had Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Promiſes, Commands, Intreaties, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Afflictions, yet nothing to this day could prevail with them. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the Fool, Prov. 27. 22. <hi>Tho' thou bray a Fool in a Mortar, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him;</hi> may be applied here, to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of affection that is found in young Folks
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:39105:93"/>
to vain and ſinful pleaſures: there is it's true a great unwillingneſs in others to forgo the pleaſures of Sin, but it ſtrangely tyrannizes over Youth; wherefore I ſhall lay down ſome Arguments, to perſuade you to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to flee this Youthful Luſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (young People) he was not a Man of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Griefs, and how unſuitable are you to him, while you pant after vain Pleaſures. I remember I have read of five Men met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that asked one another, <hi>What means they uſed to abſtain and flee from Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt anſwer'd, <hi>That he continually thought upon the Certainty of Death, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of the Time of it, and that made him live every day as his laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second, <hi>Meditated on the ſevere Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he was to give at the day of judgment, and of the everlaſting Torments of Hell, and this kept him from Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third, <hi>Of the vileneſs and loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, and of the excellency and beauty of Grace and this made him abhor Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth, <hi>Of the everlaſting Rewards and Pleaſures provided for thoſe that did abſtain from Sin, and this prevailed with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth and laſt, <hi>Continually meditated on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Love to poor</hi>

                  <hi>ainners, in dying an accurſed death for them, Snd this made him aſhamed to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly this laſt is the greateſt of all<hi>:</hi> O what an Argument is this, to conſtrain you Young Ones to flee ſinful Pleaſures; I beſeech you, for Chriſt's ſake, to flee them. Methinks if Chriſt ſhould come and demand your Life and Blood, they ſhould freely go, and will you not part with your brutiſh Pleaſures for him? You are certainly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Croſs of Chriſt, while you mind earthly Pleaſures; he lived a ſelf denying life, mortified to all the Vanities of this World, to ſet you an Example; he died al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to redeem you from a vain Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>O Young Man, view thy Pattern, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate your Self-denying Saviour, or you are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If a Father or Mother come in competition with his Name and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, you are bound to hate them, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16. much more your youthful Luſts of vile Pleaſure. The Pleaſure of our dear Lord, <hi>was to do the Will of his heavenly Father,</hi> Joh. 4. 34. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you, as was in Chriſt.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth not come after me, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> You are not to come after us Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters one ſtep, but as we conform to Chriſt. O look unto Jeſus, Young Ones, did he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sports and Games? Did he uſe to ſpend

hours at Cards or Dice, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> You read of whole Nights he redeem'd for, and ſpent in, Prayer, and how he went up and down al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doing good. O what a bleſſed way would this be, to recover the licentious Youth of this Age, to the gravity and purity of Religion, if they would write after, and draw each line of their Lives according to this holy Pattern. I have read of an Earl called <hi>Elzearus,</hi> that was given much to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate anger, and the means he uſed to cure this diſordered affection, was by ſtudying Chriſt and his patience, in ſuffering the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Affronts that were offered to him; and he never ſuffered this Meditation to paſs from him, till he found his heart transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſimilitude of Jeſus Chriſt. O Young Men, you are all diſtemper'd with the immoderate love of vain pleaſure; O flee to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> to a crucified Jeſus, and there repreſent to thy Soul his Sorrows and Agonies, till thou find this Luſt crucifi'd. Argue thus with thy ſelf, what did ſo dear ſo great and glorious a Perſon as the Son of God, deny himſelf thoſe ineffable pleaſures above, that he had in his Father's boſom, and come down here on earth. and took to himſelf an houſe of Clay, our Fleſh, which proved to him an houſe of mourning all the days of his fleſh, and then dyed an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, painful, accurſed death, and all this for me, to redeem me from the pleaſures
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39105:94"/>
of Sin, and deſtroy theſe works of the Devil: And ſhall I think much of denying my ſelf a few draughts of vain delight for him, who drank of the bitter Cup of God's wrath, and the gall and vinegar for me? And then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider that either you muſt forſake theſe ſinful pleaſures for a time here, or your ſweet Saviour for ever hereafter: <hi>For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, Conſider Young Man, <hi>Tbat God will bring thee to judgment for all thy ſinful pleaſures.</hi> Is it not enough to embitter all thy pleaſures in the fleſh, to read in Faith

that one Scripture, Eccleſ. 11. 9. <hi>Rejoyce, O young Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but know that God will bring thee to judgment.</hi> You are apt to think that you ſhall hear of them no more, but be you aſſured all muſt come into the Judgment. O Young Men, how many are now under wrath, that when on Earth, were eager in their purſuit of Games and Sports, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O Youth, conſider, the Feet of them that have carried multitudes of your Age to Perdition, ſtand ready waiting for the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to carry you away alſo. Hence it was, that the primitive Chriſtians uſed to pray, <hi>Domine hic ure, hic ſeca, ut in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num parcas.</hi> Lord, burn here, cut here, that thou may'ſt ſpare hereafter. O remember <hi>Abraham</hi>'s words to him that lived in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure while on Earth, and at laſt dying, and lifting up his eyes in Hell, and calling for a drop of water to cool his tormented tongue, <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham) thou hadſt thy pleaſures in thy life-tme, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> Luke 16. 25. O that this were more thought on by our jolly Youngſters! <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw need of uſing this tremendous Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11. <hi>For we muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And then it follows, <hi>Knowing the terrors of the Lord, we perſuade Men:</hi> To what? why to Self-judging, and Godly-ſorrowing and mourning for Sin, that ſo they may not be condemned of the Lord, at that great and

terrible day. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf beat down his Body, denied himſelf fleſhly pleaſures, leſt at that day he ſhould be a <hi>Caſt-away.</hi> Hence <hi>Peter</hi> interrogates, <hi>Seeing all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved at that day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs; not in chambering and wantonneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11. Hence alſo is the force of that great Command to a preſent Repentance without delay, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. <hi>Becauſe God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world by Chriſt.</hi> It was this that made voluptuous <hi>Felix</hi> tremble.

O young men, evermore keep your Eye on the ending of Sin, how it goes off at laſt, you may ſee in <hi>Cain,</hi> and Spira, with hideous groans, and conſuming griefs; it comes on like an Harlot very Comically, <hi>Come, let us take our fill of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> but it goes off like <hi>Rachel,</hi> weeping and bitterly lamenting. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 17, 18. <hi>My Son, envy not Sinners, for ſurely there is an end;</hi> and a ſad and woful end too, envy them not, they are rather objects of Compaſſion and Pity, to ſee a Sinner merrily for a minute, ſwallowing the bait of pleaſure, and then to conſider his end is to be torn for ever with the hook of Vengeance; and after a little gigling, and fooliſh mirth, to be caſt into a Lake of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O happy is he that foreſeeth the bitter end of Sin at laſt, and ſhunneth it, by forgoing, and fleeing the bewitching pleaſure of Sin at preſent, and wiſe is he that takes up (out of the Word of God) the ſame thoughts of Sin, now amidſt all temptations and allurements to it; as the worſt, at laſt will be forced to take up, out of their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and feeling, amidſt all the torments of Hell. Sure it is better to go to Heaven with labour, than to Hell with pleaſure, and to be preſerved in Brine, than to rot

in Honey (as one ſaith) to be fed upon ſalt Marſhes, and ſhort Commons, and to live, than to be glutted in rank Paſtures, and ſo fatted up for deſtruction. Wherefore, O youth, call not, chooſe not that pleaſure now, that thouſands are ſuffering the wrath of God for in Hell. All you that have adventured, and took the ſweet Bait, my advice to ſuch is, let them vomit up their Morſels again, and ſmite on their Breaſt, and lament with penitent remorſe, that ever they ſhould be ſuch fools, as to delight in that which hath grieved God, and wounded their own Souls, and never any more return with the Dog to the Vomit.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:39105:100"/>
off her Cloaths, laid them by the Water ſide; but Sorrow having hid her ſelf in the Covert as unſeen, ſteals the Cloaths away, puts them on, and ſo departs. Hence multitudes are cheated, they run, and ride, court, and woo Pleaſure; which they have no ſooner obtained, but they perceive their Error, alas it is nothing but Sorrow got in Pleaſures Cloaths. O young man, that art ſo eager after Pleaſures, you know not what you ſo earneſtly reach after, do but enquire of thoſe that have detected the Cheat, and they will tell you, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the world ſo deceitful as Sin: it deceived Angels above, and Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, it promiſeth credit, and pays with ſhame; it promiſeth eaſe, and pays with pain; it promiſeth Bread, and pays with Stones; it promiſeth a Paradiſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and pays with a Wilderneſs of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; it promiſeth Liberty, and pays with Bondage; it promiſeth Satisfaction and Content, and pays with nothing but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſappointment.

Alas young men, if you would bring things to a cloſe tryal and ſcrutiny, the vail of Sins pretences is ſo thin, that you might preſently detect its falſhood, and in unmasking and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it Lyes, you would rcceive much advantage, in fortifying you againſt its Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements.

Were that man hurt that ſhould have a glaſs of Poyſon took out of his Hand, and a Cup of Sack put in? O youth, I muſt not ſpare to tell thee, that thou wilt never taſte one drop of true Delight and Pleaſure, till thou art converted, and become ſeriouſly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<hi>:</hi> It is no part of God's meaning, when

               <head>Remedies againſt that Youthful Sin of Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit.</head>
               <p>I Have ſhewed you how prone Youth is to quench the Motions of the Spirit of God, ſtifling thoſe inward Convictions that are wrought in them of their loſt and undone eſtate by Nature, of the neceſſity of Converſion, and the New Birth, and of their indiſpenſible Duty to uſe the means both publick and private, that God hath appointed in order to their Converſion; there are not a few of <hi>London</hi>'s Youth that are guilty in a high degree of this Sin.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39105:119"/>
Wherefore to prevent it for time to come, attend to theſe following directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Underſtand wherein this Sin of Quenching the Spirit ſtands, and that's the firſt ſtep to Reformation in this point. Quenching is a metaphorical part of Speech, it is borrowed from a Fire or Lamp, that uſeth to give light and heat; now this applied to the Spirit, it muſt follow that the Spirit is a Fire heating, and Light enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Soul; and therefore in reference hereunto, the Apoſtle in the 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. ſaith, <hi>Quench not the Spirit:</hi> how that is done, may be gathered from the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor thus, a Fire or Light is two manner of ways quenched, (1.) By withdrawing of Fuel from it<hi>:</hi> (2.) By caſting of Water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. So it is here with this heavenly Fire, (1.) When we withdraw from the means, as Prayer, and the Word, and Holy Watchfulneſs, theſe are as materials to keep in the Fire; and when we decline, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain theſe, we quench the Spirit in his Influences, they decay and dye away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: Miſcarriages of this kind Divines call <hi>Omiſſions.</hi> (2.) When (though we do not decline Ordinances) we adventure upon commiſſions of Sin; this now extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and directly quencheth the Spirit's light and heat; this is as water caſt on, it preſently puts out the Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:39105:119"/>
O that young ones would attend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, for want of regarding theſe things many periſh, and go to Hell. If ever any thing was to be deplored in this world, this is to be deplored, that the Spirit of God, when he comes with his Light and Heat to ſanctifie and ſave us, we grieve him, reſiſt him, tempt him, vex him, quench him, theſe are all Scripture expreſſions. O Lord, what account ſhall there be at that great and terrible Day for theſe things! Learn hence young ones, that when you have this bleſſed Spirit, either in Sermon-time, or other times, like a Sun riſing and ſhining into your dark Soul's, ſhewing you as clear as Noon-day, that your Courſes have been naught, that thus, and thus, haſt thou done; and that without the New Creature, Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou art undone for ever; and ſhewing thee far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thou haſt before thee a bleſſed offer of Chriſt, and the great Salvation, purchaſed with his Blood, aſuring thee if thou caſt away thy Trangreſſions, and come in, and accept the Grace offered, thou ſhalt not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life; and probably this bleſſed Spirit goes on further, awakening thy Conſcience, ſtirring up thy Affections, that thou goeſt from the Sermon ſmitten, wounded as with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſticking within thee; ſo that thou haſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:39105:120"/>
ſome Light and Heat too: (a mercy thou canſt never enough value.) If now thou trifleſt, and groweſt careleſs of means, and through neglect of Prayer, and omiſſion of other Duties, ſuffereſt theſe Sparks to dye in the Embers; then thou art verily guilty of this horrible Sin, of quenching the Spirit: much more if (inſtead of calling for the Bellows, and blowing while there is a Fire) thou adventureſt to caſt on Water, <hi>i. e.</hi> to run into Evil Company, to yield to thy vile Corruptions, to drink the poyſoned Cup, and eat of the forbidden murdering Morſels; then be ſute with an high hand, with a witneſs, you are guilty of quenching the Spirit. O the unſpeakable miſery this brings! O that ever you can hear theſe things without Trembling! This is the firſt direction, to get a true Knowledge what this Sin is.</p>
               <p>2. When you know it, ſtudy the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and hainous nature of it, that your wanton Hearts may be awed, and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the leſt approaches towards it for time to come. O young people, is it now a time of the Spirit's ſtriving in you, ſtirring of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtriving with you? O take heed, for now is Satan moſt converſant, and inſtant to pick out your Eyes, to blow out the Light, And this he can never do
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:39105:120"/>
without thy own agency, and compliance with him; though he is a Creature full of Malice, Subtilty, and of great Power, yet (bleſſed be God, he cannot force you; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you he will, you muſt expect it now more than ever, for now he is afraid of loſing you. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 42. therefore look for your ſhare: but though he hath an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Power, yet he hath not an enforcing Power. Hence in <hi>James</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee.</hi> But now if inſtead of reſiſting the evil Spirit, you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Good Spirit, for both may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; O the grievous and hainous Nature of this Sin, words can't expreſs it<hi>:</hi> without all queſtion it's greatly influential towards the filling up the Meaſure of Sin, and the Vials of God's Wrath. And it may be ſaid of ſuch, as the Apoſtle hath it in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>It had been better they had never known the Way of Righteouſneſs, than having known it, to turn away from the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment given to them.</hi> They are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of theſe threatned Judgments, <hi>John</hi> 12. 40. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 12. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 17. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 13. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. O that young ones, would read and tremble at theſe Scriptures, to deter them from quenching the Spirit, as they would ever eſcape having their lot and portion, in ſuch dreadful and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:39105:121"/>
Judgments, as are contained in thoſe places. O take warning, Young Men, leſt you be hardned to deſtruction<hi>:</hi> God hath removed many a one of your Equals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; neglected Talents have been taken away from many Drones and Dallyers, according to that 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>Whoſoever hath not,</hi> (i. e. improves not,) <hi>from him ſhall be taken away, that which he ſeems to have.</hi> There is no prevention of this Judgment, but by improving your Talents, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of your Peace in your day.</p>
               <p>3. Never reſt in Convictions, till they bring you to reſt in Chriſt. Many, when under ſome ſenſe of Sin and Miſery, and ſome apprehenſions of Mercy, they will go and pray, and may be weep too; and upon this (without real union to and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt and his Blood) they grow well again, and think now all the danger is over, I am a new man; I was Prayerleſs, now I Pray; I was a careleſs wretch, careleſs of God, and my Soul; but now I bleſs God things are quite otherwiſe with me, and my Houſe is ſwept and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the unclean Spirit that is gone, will return no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here multitudes take up their Reſt ſhort of Chriſt, patching up a Righteouſneſs of their own, hoping by their pedling Wares to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39105:121"/>
and all this while ignorant of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, or at leaſt ſee no ſuch abſolute neceſſity of him; ſo that the Peace and Reſt they get, is not from Chriſt's Blood, but their own Prayers and Tears; not from his attonement, but their own amendment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as multitdes take up their ſtand here, ſo from hence may they date their fatal fall. Wherefore I beſeech you reſt not in any thing of your own, ſhort of Chriſt; and to the end you may not, I add in the next place,</p>
               <p>4. Study that great Scripture, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood:</hi> and what followeth, pray mark, twice it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>to declare his Righteouſneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins:</hi> and in the cloſe of the 26. verſe, <hi>That God might be juſt, in juſtifying the Sinner that believes in Chriſt.</hi> For the opening of this a little, I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the caſe between God and man ſtood thus, God made man upright, man ſins, falls under the ſanction of that Law he broke, viz. <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye.</hi> Now ſuch is the Holineſs of God's Nature, that he cannot but hate Sin, and ſuch is the Impartiality of his Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may ſooner paſs away, than
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:39105:122"/>
the leaſt Jot or Tittle of his Law paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unaccompliſhed, though fooliſh Sinners make nothing of breaking it: Well then, the great caſe is, How ſhall Sin be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Sinner ſaved? If Juſtice come upon the Sinner for ſatisfaction, it will ſwallow him up in the Gulf of eternal miſery: Therefore had this queſtion been put to the innumerable Hoſt of Angels in Heaven, what way ſinful man could be ſaved, and yet Juſtice ſatisfied, and the Law fulfilled? They would have been everlaſtingly puzled and pos'd; no leſs then the infinite Wiſdom of God could ever have found it out, which is called Wiſdom in a Myſtery. Now that Myſtery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in this glorious Text, <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent, and ſet forth his own Son in our Natures, to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice, as well as his Grace and Mercy, in pardoning and ſaving ſuch, and only ſuch as believe in Jeſus.</hi> So that if you neglect Chriſt, and Faith in his Blood, do what you will, you will be ſtill under the Curſe of the Law, and the Wrath of God, you can never eſcape Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it's impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe<hi>:</hi> without the ſhedding of Blood, there can be no Remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. It cannot be the Blood of a meer Creature that can
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:39105:122"/>
take away Sin; it muſt be the Blood of that Immaculate Lamb of God<hi>:</hi> And when all this is underſtood, there is another great Truth you muſt know, and that is, that there muſt be Faith in this Blood, or there can be no actual Remiſſion of your Sins<hi>:</hi> and therefore in vain do Sinners ſupport their hopes of pardon in Heaven, with their own Righteouſneſs, ſaying, We have ſinned, but God is merciful, and we now repent and reform, and turn to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas poor Soul, can theſe make Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make up a Ranſom and Price for a Sinner's Redemption; what need Chriſt have ſhed his Blood then? It's true, theſe Duties are excellent in their due place, and muſt be performed: but will you put them in Chriſt's room, and make Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of them, then you put an undoing Cheat upon your poor Souls, and will miſcarry for ever under your Convictions, and amidſt all your Performances; for he that believeth not, the Wrath of God abideth on him, and he ſhall not ſee Life. And therefore if you would not quench the bleſſed Spirit, and periſh after all his ſtrivings with you, and ſhewing you your Sin and Miſery. I add in the next Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:39105:123"/>
5. Prayer, this is an excellent means, to prevent miſcarrying under the operations, and workings of the Spirit of God. O let nothing be able to keep God, and your Souls aſunder<hi>:</hi> Are you under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the Spirit, and don't know what courſe to take for Peace with God, and freedom from Condemnation? Away to the Throne of Grace, and there pour out thy Complaints into the Boſom of God, and ſay,</p>
               <q>O Lord! I am a ſinful wretched vile miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creature, I have deſtroyed my ſelf; time was I was ignorant, and knew it not, but now thy Spirit has awakened my Conſcience, and opened my blind Eyes to ſee my Sin and Miſery; ſo that I am now convinc'd, that I muſt be damned without Faith in a crucified Chriſt; but alas, Lord, I have ſuch a curſed baſe deceitful hard and unbelieving Heart in me, that I can't tell what in the world to do for an Intereſt in Chriſt. Lord, I am without ſtrength, I beſeech thee to pity a poor undone Sinner, that is now driven to thy Door by want and miſery.</q>
               <p>And here plead hard, and make Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for an Heart to believe, and that in ſpite of all Diſcouragements; firſt tell him, what thou haſt heard of his Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and tender Compaſſion, That the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:39105:123"/>
King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a merciful King, and that thou haſt heard of an Eternal Deſign of Grace to poor Sinners, and how in the Fulneſs of Time he ſent his Son to ſeek and to ſave what was loſt, and opened a Fountain of Grace, and eſtabliſhed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant of Grace in the Blood of Chriſt, and now has ſet forth in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel his Son to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, and has made procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to all rebellious Sinners to come in, and accept of Mercy through Chriſt, and commanded upon pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take Chriſt, and with him all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good. Then plead thy compliance with the Goſpel-Call, and ſay, <hi>O bleſſed Lord! in obedience to thy Call, lo I am come here, a poor trembling ſtarving Beggar, that of all that ever came in, and knocked at thy Door; none more in need of a Saviour and Salvation than I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here ſuggeſt thy Wants, and ſay, <hi>Lord I want Faith, I have (through thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) awakenings of Conſcience, but I want to be in Chriſt, that my Nature may be renewed: I ſee my undone ſtate without him, but I want union with him. Lord! while I am without Chriſt, I am without ſtrength. O draw me, O let it be the Day of thy Power; haſt thou not ſaid, no man can come except thou draw? and dear Lord, I find the impotency of my</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:39105:124"/>
                  <hi>own cannot; O let me find the Efficacy of thy own Power, and feel the vertue of thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Arm drawing me to Chriſt. Lord, perſwade me; make my Heart to ſtoop, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due my ſtrong Corruptions, diſpoſſeſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm that malignant party in my Soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh thoſe ſtrong Holds of Sin and Hell there. O Lord! this is a ſad condition, to be unreconciled to thee, and uneſpouſed to Chriſt. O pity and help one that ſeeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to believe, but has not ſtrength enough; my Inſufficiencies are equal with my Neceſſities, though I can never get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without Faith and Holineſs; and though I know I want both, yet Lord thou knoweſt, I am no more able to change my ſinful nature, and be the Author of Faith to my ſelf, than I am to create a World, or quicken and raiſe the Dead; but if thou wilt make bare thy Arm, it will ſoon be done, my proud Heart ſhall ſoon be humble, my hard Heart ſhall ſoon become ſoft, my unbelieving Heart be made believing: O ſpeak but the Word, and a poor Sinner that has fear'd burning in Hell hundreds of times, ſhall ſing thy Praiſe; O thou that commandeſt me to turn, Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here plead his Promiſe, and Chriſt's Purchaſe after ſome ſuch manner as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed Lord! haſt thou not promiſed, that thou wilt not caſt out him that cometh to</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:39105:124"/>
                  <hi>thee; and that thou wilt give thy holy Spirit to him that aſks, and that it ſhall be opened to him that knocks; and that thou wilt take away the Heart of Stone, and give a Heart of Fleſh, and give a New Heart, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Sin no more: Lord, if theſe be not thine own Promiſes, I'll be content to go away empty. And are not all thy Promiſes yea, and Amen? Is it not one of thy Titles, God who cannot lye hath promiſed. And thou never yet didſt break thy Word with any poor Sinner, nor ſuffer the Word that has gone out of thy Mouth to fail, but art the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for ever, in whom there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning. O remember thy Word, wherein and whereon thou haſt made me to hope; and remember me a poor Sinner now at thy Feet, laden with Iniquity, groaning and labouring under a burthen, too heavy for me to bear: and O remember thy Son's Blood, and if that be not ſufficient to diſcharge all I owe, and procure all I want, then let Juſtice ſeize me.</hi> Tell God, He will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paid with Chriſt's Blood, than thy own, and that his Juſtice will have more Glory in ſaving thee for the ſake of Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, than in damning thee for the ſake of thy own diſobedience; that if he throw thee into the Priſon of Hell, to pay what thou oweſt, he will never have a full
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:39105:125"/>
ſatisfaction; but if the ſave thee, and take thee up to Heaven, upon the account of Chriſt's Blood, he will have all paid at one ſum, and receive a plenary ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And tell him, That thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to leave him to the laſt gaſp, until he Bleſs thee with the Grace and Mercy thou needeſt, till it be out of doubt that thou art in Chriſt, and throughly converted, ſay, <hi>This I muſt have, there is no enduring of it, I will mourn, and be in bitterneſs, while I have a being, till I find this Grace in thy ſight; O I will never depart from thy Door, whither ſhould I go, thou alone haſt the Words of Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And know for thy Comfort, that when once it cometh to this, never queſtion it, thou ſhalt have an anſwer of Grace to thy comfort and content. God's bowels will yern towards you, as they did to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and the Prodigal Son at his return.</p>
               <p>And thus now I have done, and I know that e're long God will bring me and you by Death to Judgment; but whether ever he will bring me to this place to ſpeak more, or you to hear more, I know not: I have endeavoured to warn you, and wooe you, and win you to Chriſt; I have told you again, and again, this can never be, except you flee your
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:39105:125"/>
youthful Luſts: I have deſcribed them to you, and laid down Directions how to Flee theſe Luſts, excepting the five laſt, <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculing ſerious Godlineſs, Swearing, Time-waſting <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs:</hi> and, which is laſt, <hi>a Woful giddineſs and greedineſs of temper to drink down Errours.</hi> But having not in publick as yet inſiſted on theſe at large, I forbear the Printing of them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in the concluſion, I demand of you, Young People, what is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution? Dare any of you maintain a league and friendſhip with your Luſts, in rebellion againſt the expreſs Command and Call of God; to flee them; if ſo, O remember theſe Truths once Preached, and now Printed (as deſpiſed as they are now) will be a ſwift and fearful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you another day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you, like as the appearance of the Fingers of a man's Hand on the Wall, did that ſtout Sinner <hi>Belſhazar.</hi> For who ever hardened himſelf againſt God and proſpered?</p>
               <p>Well, once more, and may be no more for ever, I ask you, in the Name of him that made you, and will judge you, will you flee your Luſts or no? Will you lay down theſe Weapons, and take Jeſus, and be ruled by him or no? O let
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:39105:126"/>
thy Voice be with the Prodigal, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and ſay, I have ſinned.</hi> Or with <hi>Ephraim, What have I any more to do with Idols? Behold thou art the Lord our God, we come, we come.</hi> O that God would make me the happy Inſtrument of converting Grace, this day, while it's called to day. O who can endure to ſee Satan get Souls to Hell from under our Pulpit. O awake, awake, up and be doing, it may be the laſt knock Chriſt by me will give: I am wounded to think of leaving any of you in Hell's way: The Lord give you underſtanding in all things.</p>
